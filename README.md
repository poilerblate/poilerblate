Boilerplate app to make React bootstrapping easier.

What's included:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
- [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Building

Issue command `npm run build`. Production ready bundle is stored in `dist/` and can be copied to the server.

## Running tests

Issue command `npm test`. It runs test cases once and exits.

If you want to run tests in watch mode, you can either install [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) globally with `npm i -g jest` and call it with `jest --watch` or do it with npm scripts with `npm test -- --watch`. Latter does not require you to install `jest` globally.

Component specific tests are stored in `src/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.test.js` and actions/reducers tests in `__tests__/` respectively.

## Development

Type `npm start` and development server is launched to http://localhost:3000. If you want to set another port, environment variable PORT can be passed to the start script by setting an environment variable `PORT=4000 npm start`.

Main index page template is located in `src/templates/index.html`.

All code must be located in `src/`.

### Debug mode

You can add an environment variable `DEBUG` to make webpack output be more verbose.
